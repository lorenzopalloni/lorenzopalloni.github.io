      <description>Jealousy
/Ààd íel.…ô.si/
noun
‚ÄúA tormenting feeling caused by the fear, suspicion, or certainty of losing the loved one to someone else.‚Äù

      <description>Hi there! üòä
I gathered here all the steps that I took to install Arch Linux on my desktop computer. The main purpose of this post is for personal future reference, but I think (and hope) that someone else might find it useful as well.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start! I assume that you are in the installation environment, logged in the first virtual console as the root user, and presented with a Zsh shell prompt.</description>
