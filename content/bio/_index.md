I am an M.Sc. student of Computer Science (Data Science specialization) at the University of Florence, where I previously obtained a bachelor's degree in Statistics. The academic and work challenges I have faced so far have helped me develop a strong passion for Statistics, Computer Science and Mathematics, especially with a focus on Machine Learning applications.

In my leisure time, I enjoy working out 💪, reading non-fictional books about personal development and psychology 📚, and skateboarding 🏂.
