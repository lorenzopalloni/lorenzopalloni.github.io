My passion lies in bridging the gap between Machine Learning and Embedded Systems (a field known as TinyML). I am a lifelong learner, driven by the desire to implement innovative solutions, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate in multicultural and fast-paced environments to develop products that positively impact the world.

Outside my canonical work hours, you can find me skating on my mini-cruiser or reading non-fiction books about personal development and psychology. Despite being a teetotaler who avoids drugs, I surprisingly find dancing to tekno music an excellent stress-reliever and cardio workout. I value socializing, especially on weekends and I'm committed to self-improvement and positively influencing others, always aiming for win-win situations in my interactions. During the weekdays, my early mornings are dedicated to focused study sessions, while late afternoons are reserved for gym time.

Ah, I use Arch (and Vim), BTW.
