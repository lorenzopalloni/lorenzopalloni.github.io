As a Machine Learning Engineer, I thrive at the intersection of industry and academia, embracing research and engineering with equal fervor. My passion lies in implementing innovative solutions, contributing to open-source projects, and collaborating in multicultural environments to develop products that have a positive impact on the world.

I'm truly passionate about Statistics, Computer Science, and Mathematics, especially considering them as a means to Machine Learning applications.

Academically, I hold a Bachelor's in Statistics and a Master's in Computer Science with a focus on Data Science. Professionally, I have over a year of experience as a Data Scientist at Swiss Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, and over a year as an R&D Machine Learning Engineer at Henesis Srl, a private research department.

Beyond work, I'm a weighted calisthenics enthusiast ðŸ’ª and I enjoy reading non-fiction books on personal development and psychology ðŸ“š.
