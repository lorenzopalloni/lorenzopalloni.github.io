Hi there! üòä

I gathered here all the steps that I took to install [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) on my desktop computer.
The main purpose of this post is for personal future reference, but I think (and hope) that someone else might find it useful as well.

### Let's start!

I assume that you are in the installation environment, logged in the first virtual console as the root user, and presented with a Zsh shell prompt. If not, follow the first steps described [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide).

Enable internet access through `iwctl` for Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable.

```zsh
timedatectl set-ntp true
```

```zsh
fdisk /dev/nvme0n1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p2
mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1
mkswap /dev/nvme0n1p3
swapon /dev/nvme0n1p3
```

```zsh
mount /dev/nvmen0p1p2 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/nvmen0p1p1 /mnt/boot
```

```zsh
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware vim iwd dhcpcd networkmanager iproute2
```

```zsh
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

```zsh
arch-chroot /mnt
```

```zsh
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Rome /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
```

Edit /etc/locale.gen uncommenting "en\_US.UTF-8 UTF-8"
```zsh
locale-gen
```

Generate: `/etc/locale.conf` with "LANG=en\_US.UTF-8"
```zsh
echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
```
Generate: `/etc/hostname` with \<your-hostname\>
```zsh
echo <your-hostname> > /etc/hostname
```

Edit /etc/hosts with 127.0.0.1 stuff

```zsh
mkinitcpio -P
systemctl enable --now dhcpcd
systemctl enable --now NetworkManager
passwd
```

```zsh
pacman -S grub
pacman -S efibootmgr
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --removable
```

In the new system run:
```zsh
launch this: systemctl enable --now dhcpcd.service
launch this: systemctl enable --now NetworkManager.service
connect with iwctl
```

Add a new user \<user-name\>
```zsh
pacman -S sudo
install zsh
useradd -m <user-name> --shell /bin/zsh
passwd <user-name>
visudo /etc/sudoers (add the following line: "<user-name> ALL=(ALL) ALL")
su <user-name>
```

```zsh
pacman -S xorg
pacman -S gnome
systemctl start gdm.service
systemctl enable gdm.service
exit
```

I didn't install the following, but Arch Wiki suggests to do so:
```zsh
pacman -S intel-ucode
```

Edit `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` with "MODULES="hid-logitech-hidpp"
Recreate the initrd for the kernel with
```zsh
mkinitcpio -p linux-lts
```

### List of useful packages:

```zsh
pacman -S \
    cmatrix \
    cowsay \
    lolcat \
    terminal-parrot \
    rxvt-unicode \
    youtube-dl \
    base \
    e2fsprogs \
    git \
    htop \
    intel-ucode \
    iproute2 \
    iw \
    iwd \
    less \
    man-db \
    man-pages \
    openssh \
    python \
    sudo \
    textinfo \
    tmux \
    vim \
    zsh
```

### EFISTUB
[EFISTUB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFISTUB) allows ‚ÄúEFI firmware to load the kernel as an EFI executable‚Äù. Despite my motherboard should be able to support EFI firmware, I couldn't find a way to make it works. Since I spent plenty of time trying to figure out what was the problem, I want to put here the command that should have worked for future experimentations:

```zsh
!/bin/sh
blkid -p -o value -s PART_ENTRY_UUID /dev/nvme0n1p2  PARTUUID  # for root parition
efibootmgr --disk /dev/nvme0n1 --part 1 --create --label "Arch Linux" --loader '/vmlinuz-linux-lts' --unicode 'root=PARTUUID=<insert-PARTUUID-here> rw initrd=\initramfs-linux-lts.img' --verbose
```
