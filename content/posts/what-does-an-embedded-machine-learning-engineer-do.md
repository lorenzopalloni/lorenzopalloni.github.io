Two years ago, I joined the company which I am currently working for as a Machine Learning Engineer. My main responsibility was to develop an Instance Segmentation model (Computer Vision) for a real-time application. After a year, the project was halted due to funding contraints.

Around the same time, the only Embedded Firmware Engineer in the company, whom I'll refer to as `Foo`, decided to leave. Our CTO, aware of my interest in low-level programming, approached me with an unexpected opportunity. He asked me if I could take on Foo's responsibilities temporarily until a new engineer could be hired.
Foo was maintaing the firmware for a custom piece of hardware made by my company to stream data from various sensors through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology. The hardware featured an nRF52840 chip and several sensors (ADC, IMU, PPG, Fuel Gauge) which should have been streaming data at specific frequencies.

I accepted the challenge and started taking on Foo's work while learning the basics of Embedded Systems, but I wasn't very confident of my choice. The more time was spending on learning, the more I was realising how much this field was hard to tame. My passion though, was growing alongside the difficulties I was facing. I started to develop a curiosity around current, voltage, resistance, and Electronics in general. I couldn't believe that behind those tiny pieces there was such a gigantic world.

The hiring process for a new Embedded Firmware Engineer was taking more than usual. This was probably due to the summer period, when the pace of work in Italy tends to slow down.

When Foo ended his notice period, I wasn't expecting to be hooked so much to this field.


The firmware was barely working, and I had to adjust the whole infrastructure to make it work properly.


After a couple of months deepening the subject, I realised I was developing a new passion: I wanted to bridge the gap between Embedded Systems and Machine Learning. I knew from the start it would take me an enormous amount of time to learn the basics of Embedded Systems. I had experience in Computer Programming, but I had no clue of how current works. I am a big fan of hard challenges, so I step into this career shift, asking my line manager to stop seeking a new Embedded Firmware Engineer, confident that I would replace the old Foo pretty soon.
One year has passed, and now I am fully recognized as an Embedded Machine Learning Engineer.
I got a new title and a +22% raise of my salary, that's huge! Not only for the money, but especially for the recognition of the quality of my work. Now I feel I can indipendently work as an Embedded Firmware Engineer as well as an ML Engineer.

The path through here hasn't been easy at all. I spent the majority of my time learning and solving work issues. I was lucky to be able to work on a custom PCB with several sensors (ADC, IMU, PPG, Fuel Gauge), where the firmware was barely working. I had to adjust the whole firmware infrastructure to make the board streaming at specific frequencies each sensor's values through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology.

I started to write this post while I was trying to outline the job description of my new role. Online I couldn't find much information about which responsibilities an Embedded Machine Learning Engineer actually has, so I thought it could be helpful for someone other than me to start writing something on my own.

The job description is technical and somewhat specific to my current role, within the company I am working for. However, I believe it can serve as a starting point.


I read the book "Making Embedded Systems" by Elicia White, I leverage a lot ChatGPT as a personal tutor, asking questions after questions about what I didn't know.
I watched a lot of YouTube courses, from Miro Samek's 



More than one year ago, I dipped my toes in the Embedded Systems world.
I was a Machine Learning Engineer, and I was working on developing and deploying machine learning models for Computer Vision applications working mostly in a Python programming language. I was fascinated by low-level programming and the idea of making real-world applications smarter. So, I decided to make a career shift and become an Embedded Machine Learning Engineer. It is May 

It is June 2024, and there is no unique definition of what an Embedded Machine Learning Engineer does. The field is still evolving, and the roles and responsibilities of an Embedded Machine Learning Engineer can vary widely depending on the organization and the specific project.
I had to write my own job description for my current role, and I thought it would be helpful to share it with others who are interested in this field.

Too many big words for only one title, I know.
Engineer is the easy one.
What are Embedded Systems? What is Machine Learning?

An Embedded Machine Learning Engineer is in charge to bridge the gap between Embedded Systems and Machine Learning.

Embedded Systems is the field that regard tiny devices made for a specific purpose.
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intell

- I transitioned from ML to Embedded Systems, since all the Embedded Software Engineers left the company and I was the guy with most interest in low-level programming I took the chance to embark in this new unseen field.
- I learnt how the current works through self-learning, with books such as Make: Electronics, Make: More Electronics, I spent more than 1.5k euro in a home lab that I'm really proud of. I learnt the basis of RTOS with the Miro Samek's course, I enjoyed Making Embedded Systems by Elicia White, 

To understand what an Embedded Machine Learning Engineer does, we need to break down the title into its components: "Embedded", "Machine Learning", and "Engineer".

### Embedded
Embedded systems are computing systems that are designed to perform a specific task. They are often found in consumer electronics, automotive systems, and industrial machines. They are different from general-purpose computers in that they are optimized for a specific task and are often resource-constrained.

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Machine learning algorithms can be used to recognize patterns in data, make predictions, and optimize processes.

### Engineer
An engineer is a person who designs, builds, or maintains systems or products. Engineers use scientific and mathematical principles to solve problems and create new technologies.
