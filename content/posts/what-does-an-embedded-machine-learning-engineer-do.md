- I transitioned from ML to Embedded Systems, since all the Embedded Software Engineers left the company and I was the guy with most interest in low-level programming I took the chance to embark in this new unseen field.
- I learnt how the current works through self-learning, with books such as Make: Electronics, Make: More Electronics, I spent more than 1.5k euro in a home lab that I'm really proud of. I learnt the basis of RTOS with the Miro Samek's course, I enjoyed Making Embedded Systems by Elicia White, 

To understand what an Embedded Machine Learning Engineer does, we need to break down the title into its components: "Embedded", "Machine Learning", and "Engineer".

### Embedded
Embedded systems are computing systems that are designed to perform a specific task. They are often found in consumer electronics, automotive systems, and industrial machines. They are different from general-purpose computers in that they are optimized for a specific task and are often resource-constrained.

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Machine learning algorithms can be used to recognize patterns in data, make predictions, and optimize processes.

### Engineer
An engineer is a person who designs, builds, or maintains systems or products. Engineers use scientific and mathematical principles to solve problems and create new technologies.
