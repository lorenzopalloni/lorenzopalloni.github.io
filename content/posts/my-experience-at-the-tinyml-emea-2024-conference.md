## Day 1/3
Monday, the 24th of June 2024

I met Anna Bonaldo and Tobia Fiorese from Bluewind Srl. they are working on battery status prediction for automotive applications using a multicore STM MCU.

Alessandro Cremonesi, STM
added aome hype to the current TinyML hype.

Antoni Woss, MathWorks
talked about a technique to reduce LSTM size by projecting weights in lower dimensions

Michael Gibbs, Nottingham Trent University
talked about hard contextual parameter sharing

I talked with a guy from Deep Hearing that works on the firmware of a microphone that discerns voices

I chatted with a guy from Eta Compute Inc

I met Lukasz from Poland and from Arrow Electronics, and he talked about a TinyML system that predicts the level of grinding for a coffee machine needed to achieve good taste of coffee based on pressure of the coffee container, the humidity and other parameters.

I met Gian Marco Iodice.
He said that he went to CVPR and had bad times networking because there were too many people and the schedule was too tight.

I met the creator of emlearn, Jon Nordby

Francesco Conti, assistant professor UniBO
talked about the PULP Project (open source hardware)

Petrut Bogdan, Innatera
talked about their Spiking Neural Processor (SNP) that is in preproduction at the moment

Michele Magno, ETH
talked about eyeglasses to track eye movement

Francesca Paissan, ETH
presented a paper about tinyCLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining
https://francescopaissan.it/tinyclapweb/

Philippe Bich, Polytechnic of Turin
interesting approach to reduce model weight size, replacing MAC (Multiply and ACcumulate) with MAM (multiply and max/min)

Charbel Rizk, Founder and CEO, Oculi
https://www.oculi.ai

Denis Mikhaylov, Researcher , D-ITET, ETH
system with barometers for on-site data collections on cracks for wind turbine
 
I talked with Nabarun, from STM that works on motor and power control Edge AI applications

## Day 2/3
Tuesday, the 25th of June 2024

Diana Trojaniello, Project Manager, Luxottica
too high level

Alessandro Grande, Head of Product, Edge Impulse

Leonardo Cavagnis, Firmware Engineer, Arduino
Workshop with Arduino and Edge Impulse

Danilo Pau, Technical Director, STM

Danil Zherebtsov, Head of Machine Learning & Analytics, Neuton.AI

George, from Arrow shoed me Alif semiconductor's chips

Jon NORDBY, CTO, Soundsensing
emlearn

Elia CEREDA, PhD Student, IDSIA, USI-SUPSI

Wassim KEZAI, Software Engineer, Innovation Academy

Massimo PAVAN, PhD Student, Politecnico di Milano
Anomaly Detection using UWB technology using one-class SVM (radial basis function as a kernel)

Jona BEYSENS, Senior R&D Engineer, CSEM
Aurora, acoustic smart weather station

Andreas from imaginmob showed me a cool dev kit

Jone Beysens suggested to compete in challenges such as the one organized by TinyML Foundation and others.


Panel - Challenges of tinyML Applications
Panelists:

Laleh Makarem – Logitech

Nicolo Annino – Idealarm Ltd

Eric Benhaim – Oro Sound

Armando Caltabiano – Truesense Srl

Jerome Schang – Alif Semiconductor

This panel sessions has been quite useless for what I understood.


## Day 3/3
Wednesday, the 26th of June 2024

At this point, I had figured out that networking was the real priority here. Without attending any of the talks, it's hard to get a general sense of the atmosphere and current trends, which can also ease conversations with others. However, you can always ask someone to describe a talk you missed to engage in a conversation, or discuss a talk that both you and another person attended.

So, I didn't pay much attention to the talks on the third day. I focused more on networking and even skipped the first keynote to recover some sleep, since I went to bed at 4:00am the night before. Unfortunately, I later heard that the keynote was actually worth it, from a guy at Bosch Research, that discussed HW/SW co-design.

Evgeni asked the 5V Media team to interview me to convey the enthusiasm I was oozing for the conference to others. I was quite nervous about being interviewed, with a camera, microphone, and a nice girl asking me questions in the middle of the conference. I'm complaining, but I later saw on social media that others were also interviewed and they seemed relaxed, so I might be making this seem more stressful than it actually was.
